### Pittsburgh Police Arrest Data

Arrests

https://data.wprdc.org/datastore/dump/e03a89dd-134a-4ee8-a2bd-62c40aeebc6f

Description:

This dataset provides detailed records of arrests made by the Pittsburgh Police Department. It includes information such as arrest dates, incident locations, offense descriptions, and related demographics. We used this to calculate the total arrest counts for our selected neighborhoods. Although the dataset is labeled as specific to Pittsburgh, we noticed an 'Outside City' label under the 'IncidentNeighborhood' column. To ensure we included only incidents within Pittsburgh, we first filtered out any entries marked as 'Outside City.' Then, we narrowed down the data to just the neighborhoods we wanted to compare. Using the 'IncidentNeighborhood' column, we tallied up all the arrests for each neighborhood.
